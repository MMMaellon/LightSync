A set of scripts for syncing an object in VRChat with an emphasis on network efficiency and ease of use.

To use it, just add the `LightSync` script onto an object. Out of the box it'll handle the most common use cases of syncing physics and pickup events, but you can add additional scripts to handle things like attaching an object to a player.
